            The first semester of the master's degree is part of the field of study 
            'Ecology: Pierre et Terre'. The challenge is to design an eco-neighbourhood 
            on the site of the administrative city of the Villette Park. The administrative 
            city is now settled in prefabricated buildings built in the 75s. This unique 
            site is located between the park of the Villette and the dock of the bottom of 
            Rouvray and has a significant potential for the creation of an eco-quartier in 
            Paris.

            This project is divided into several stages. Initially, analysis and programming 
            make it possible to propose an urban project that is consistent with the context 
            of the nineteenth arrondissement of Paris. Indeed, cartographic and sociological 
            analysis makes it possible to give shape to the programme.The urban project is 
            taking shape and architectural intentions are emerging. Subsequently, his 
            architectural intentions will take shape with an individual project where the 
            challenge will be to propose a construction based on the use of geo-sourced 
            materials such as stone or earth.
